ALL ABOUT FRESHLY CLONE .
Hello reader ,we all buy food like lunch , dinner or snacks from multinational restaurants and food delivery companies . I'm sure you might have also brought using their web-apps . similar to that we have also made a clone of one of online food ordering and delivery platform named freshly.com 
so moving ahead we the team at MASAI SCHOOL have developed the clone of freshly.com during our construct week as a part of unit 2 project .
This blog will explain you how we made the project and also about our tasks that had taken up .
#Problem statement:
We are given the task of the successful cloning of a website named freshly in seven days.
LANDING PAGESIGN UP PAGEPLANS & MENU PAGECART PAGEI hope I am not overwhelming you with so many snippets. The snippets attached above are just some parts of what we have made so that you could compare them with the actual website.
#Expectations:
We are expecting to create a pixel-perfect cloned site of freshly website within seven days, with all its pages, giving proper HTML, CSS properties, using DOM and JAVASCRIPT concepts with respect to the official freshly website.
#Concepts we covered in the entire unit:
HTML
CSS
DOM
Media query
Git

#Roles and Responsibilities:
We started by going through the website, studying its design, layouts, content, ETC…..
So we had divided us in different chunks from that one of them were making Landing page and Cart page, while one was making the Sign Up and Login Page, also others we making the pages like Plans and Menu  Page, Day page and checkout Page ETC …
So before proceeding to that we conducted meetings, made strategies on the Web-page so that work can be allotted or chosen accordingly. Because as we know sharing strategies make work flow easier and also smoother.

#CHALLENGES WE FACED AND HOW WE SOLVED THEM
As it was the first time for us collaborating remotely on a project. We faced quite a few challenges while developing the clone. The challenges we can remember are as follows:-
1 . Git was fairly new to us and thus it became a challenge to merge the code and solve the conflicts.
2. Carousels animations issues & also we do faced issues on different screen sizes while sharing screens due to laptop pixel issues & in last we fixed that problems also .
3 . We faced some issues in Github when we were trying to push and merge the files we created.
4 . We had to learn how to make animations and carousels as few sections of some pages required us to create video cards, image cards, moving navbar, opening & closing animations, etc. Here, reading the documentation and looking at the snippets come in handy to solve such problems.
